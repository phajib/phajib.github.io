Ever looked at a magazine and thought, in my hands is an entire website? That's what a Single Page Application is like but without all the pages, just one. One page, but all we are doing is updating the content instead of loading page after page. It's the new school of turning a page.

The task at hand utilize everything you have learned in the Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp and make the best **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication and make sure you have a **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**interface and pair it with a Frontend. The API is in Ruby on Rails and the Frontend utilizes React, Redux and Thunk. The final result is [MUVI](https://github.com/phajib/muvi_frontend), my final project.

MUVI was inspired from IMDB, but at a more basic level. A user is able to search for a movie or select from Popular to Up Coming movies. When user signs up to MUVI, the user is able to save movies to their list and leave comments for a particular movie. I needed a movie database in order to populate MUVI's api, so I used [The Movie Data Base](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to help with that. You need to register for an API key to access TMDB's API. Once that is all set I was able to begin creating [MUVI's API](https://github.com/phajib/muvi_api).

Next step was to do the fancy and create the [MUVI's Frontend](https://github.com/phajib/muvi_frontend). Using React in combination with Redux and Thunk was definitely a challenge. It took time to appreciate what Redux and React can do for your SPA and once you have the hang of things you can still get lost and then forget what you just did just after you get it working. Definitely do plenty of git commits once something is working. At the end I managed to get a somewhat functioning SPA. 

There is still plenty of space to learn more of about React and Redux to better improve my skillset but at the same time its important to maintain the fundamentals. Technology is constantly changing and it's hard to keep up sometimes but we evolve and conquer and the cycle repeats itself because I don't think there is a *CTRL / CMD C* for this.

**ALL FOR ONE and ONE FOR ALL**, we are FLATIRON!
