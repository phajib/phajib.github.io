Oh RoR (**R**uby **o**n **R**ails) how fun you were...and the fact that I just started getting used to you and all your little straight foward talks and seeing *.erb files and *.rb files and that weird <% = thing you have, but coding life must go on and I bid you farewell...or is it?

Hello **J**ava**S**cript and **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication! Ok, I never really farewelled RoR, it's sticking around. JS and RoR go together like how Starbucks just puts all these things in or on the coffee (though coffee is already good in the simple sorts, you know flat white, latte, cappuccino, etc.). Ahh that's what you thought, **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets is all that cream and caramel drizzle and whatever else Starbucks puts. Once it's put all together and it tastes right, you have your self a Frontend and Backend Project SPA, I called mine [Booxs](https://github.com/phajib/booxs)

Ok now after typing all that I should've based my project on coffee, but anyway, back to Booxs. So the plan was to create something similar to IMDB but for books, but your not the person who casually searches for a book to see what its about, you're the one who inputs a book and tells what its about.

Currently a user can login to their account or if you haven't got an account you can sign up for one. From there you will see a listing of the current books in Booxs. You can add a new book by entering the title and author then a description of the book. If you have an image you can enter in the image url. Once you have submitted the book's information it will be listed at the bottom of the list with the image of the book. Click on it will allow you to view the description you typed up.

The next step would be to allow the user to edit book/s they have entered and maybe tidy up my code and make it more *vanilla* and robust and all the other features IMDB has...maybe.
