My take on the Sinatra Project...Where to start.

The brainstorming, it can be very time consuming. But the skeleton of th project is to *Create Read Update Delete*. Selecting an idea can either be difficult or easy. Daily jumping on the computer we would be logging on to some site. Withing the site we may possibly use *CRUD*. For those who run a blog or simply creating an email, even using an ecommerce website, you will touch o n *CRUD*.

There were various routes I could've taken in creating a Photographer's Log, but I needed to firstly get the foundation down, *CREATE*. The signup of a user, just like many sites it requires some sort of name identifier and of course a password, securing a photographers account. We then *CREATE* the photographs log by entering and filling in the New Log form. And Bob's your Uncle, you just made your first entry.

Whilst the photographer is still logged in, if you don't like your Log entry, we can edit or if you really don't like the log, we can get rid of it. Thus we *UPDATE* or *DELETE* our entry.

The same can be done with the user's account details. You can *UPDATE* your details or if you don't want to maintain an account with **CLIC** you can *DELETE* your account.

Did everything work out as planned, yes and no. Does it ever??

There were many challenges with this project. My biggest one was getting the right id's to match both user and logs. I would advise that you find a db file reader, like *DB Browser for SQLite*. I was able to view what was actually being stored as I filled in form for a new log or signing up as a new user.

Of course trust old `binding.pry`, a life saver! If you still haven't used `binding.pry`, it's like not knowing what the deal is with Chik-Fil-A vs Popeyes Chicken...really? I can't even. I prefer Shake Shack to be honest, ok, let's not go there.
Yes, `binding.pry` and a DB browser will help you tremedously!

If you're not too sure with CSS, good old Bootstrap is there to make things flow, well kind of. Getting things in order when it comes to CSS files can change how your site will appear and it can look different on different browsers. Templates can come in handy, it's just a matter of putting your skeleton of CRUD within the template. It can take a bit of fiddling but once you've figured a few `class=""` names figured out or `id=""` you'll be right!

Overall it was satisfying to know you competed *Frontend* and *Backend*, YEH YOU DID!!
