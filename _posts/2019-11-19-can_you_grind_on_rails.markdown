When I hear Rails I think of skating and grinding on hand rails. I never would've thought that Rails is a framework that belonged to the computer programming category. Now, looking at Rails is like looking at a Banksy or a Kaws piece. It's appearance is simple yet striking and effective. The project I worked on, [iDocere](https://github.com/phajib/iDocere), has given me a better appreciation of Ruby on Rails and programming overall.

So let's start with the best command line you can come across as a rookie in Ruby on Rails, `rails g scaffold ...` Ok maybe it's not the best place to start as a rookie but you can't help it and be in awe at what that command line will give you, it's a genie in a bottle waiting for you to grant your wishes. Besides that, there are other *generators* you can use to help you with your application, `rails g resource`, `rails g controller`, `rails g model`, `rails g migration` and the genie, `rails g scaffold`.

Rails is literally never ending. With the Rails community growing rapidly, you can really create so many things. One of the things that assisted in my project were Gems. I made use of Devise, Searchkick and Omniauth-google-oauth2. Devise helped build the authentication. Searchkick was used for searching the resources being created and Omniauth was so you can sign up/sign in with a google account. I also made use of Mailcatcher so I could view email authentications.

The project I worked, [iDocere](https://github.com/phajib/iDocere), on was designed for Educational Advisors in the homeschool environment or it can also be applied to the general school environment. An advisor would sign up to create an account and from there they can start creating resources. There is also a simple messaging section to help with the understanding of the resource being created. The CRUD functions are there to give flexibility to the advisor. I plan to extend my project and add a parent or student authentication and provide an Education Advisor with a better input platform in creating Resources.

I'm going to continue to explore this great world of RoR and see what else it has to provide. Let's RoR!!!
