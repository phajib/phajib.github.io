***Cereal Killer: When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. What? It's Corinthians one, chapter thirteen verse eleven.
- Hackers, movie***


The curiousity, the inspiration, to what I wanted to be, it started with "Hackers" the movie. To be able to read a language of 0s and 1s. A language which a select few can decipher and appreciate. And then "The Matrix" trilogy came out and the decision came, "You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes." I took the blue pill.

Long story short, the red pill showed me different careers paths and I gained various skill sets. You give me some hand tools, cable, switches and outlets and I'll provide you some electricity. You give me a videocamera and I'll stich together a theatrical movie that'll be embedded in your heart. You give me a camera and I'll pause life for a second and capture the emotions. But now I have to call on Cher, *[If I could turn back time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKbwR7WXN4)*, and bring *The Roots* back in the picture, [The Seed 2.0](http:// It's time for new beginnings). It's time for new beginnings and this time I'll take the red pill, Flatiron School, we're gonna win, LET'S DO THIS! ![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AnimatedUntriedBluebottlejellyfish-max-1mb.gif)
